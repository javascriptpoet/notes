An all night sesh of coding into an all sunny day sesh of soaking up an ocean view from the top of ell cerrito longboarding resort. 
I prefer rainy nights with the sparks off my bro's pucks the only clue where the next corner drift is, with endless slides around oncoming traffic and spectacular close calls, being tossed off the board at 30 into the thick mist and ocean view behind it.
But, I dont mind blue bird sunny warm days and blue white caps down below and hauling ass down mind blowing steeps and s corners and passed amused locals.

I live 
On the shores of Adrenalin ocean
The beachy mermaids
Is my only diversion

From toil
Of avoiding to pay the king's toll 
Of wasting a dime
Like a stumble in rhyme

I swim
In whitewater of kindness
I'v cured my ill
Overcame crippling blindness

I went back in time
And I'v fixed all the wrongs
Relived all my life

I became 
Timeless ghost
