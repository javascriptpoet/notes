Its a two way third eye
Roots deep 
Into the mind

Brings light from outside
Shines beauty
Of your mind

 What beauty is the structure of your thoughts. The more consistent the structure, the brighter it shines. 
 The structure of your thoughts is a fractal of the rest, the universe. 
 Therefore, the connection of the observer to the observed. We are the particles of structure and beauty - the beuaticals.<br>
 Like any particle,we mediate a force - the force of creativity, the strongest force there is, the force of organization of disorder into patterns, 
 the force that rearranges the universe itself with ease and it acts thru interactions between the beatical particles
 No interaction, no force. Right by the standard theory of quantum force fields<br>
 So, let the force be with you.
