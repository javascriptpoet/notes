The time, the only matter

The life to death
Is made of

i found thru my code, everything in universe is made out of time, literally, just ticks of time. 
I can explain better if you interested. I can, also, see that this is THE conserved quantity - 
there is only so many of them, like limited number of statements in my script (thats what those ticks are). 
So, our life's ticks need to be spent in a most wise way. Thats the only limited resource we have. 
The wisest way to spend the time for a human, imho, is with other humans, no matter what kind of humans, 
but what matters is kindness. Be kind, be human.
