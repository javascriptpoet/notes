Its tough this winter in my hood.
im actually real lucky i can go and chill in my van staying dry and cooking fat meals at my parents place 100ft away. 
a lot of those people on the streets did not see anything this nice in a very long time, at least since summer.

The rain 
divides the souls

it soaks
thru the streets of folks

Not even looking
In your window
But looking 
to be dry this winter

And to be fed
And pets be fine

To cross one day
dividing line
