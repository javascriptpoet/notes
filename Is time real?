the time
is it real?

It is and it is not
Its subjective and local
Depends on the local

Whats future?
Whatever you do next

Whats space?
Whatever left 

Whatever you and the rest decided to do 
         now
         
The future of space?
We came the full circle

Again
so it repeats
in time and space
And in my code

One structure
One process
Divided by us
Into time and space
