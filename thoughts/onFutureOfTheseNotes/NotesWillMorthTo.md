##A react web app, thats what i do. 
When i got a hammer working, at least minimally functional, i am all to anxious to use it.

React web app will be the top layer. This notes will be a cms (content management system), well familiar and comfy by then.

Refer to (related){webDev/thoughts/onCmsSystem}

###The app will have
* **notesDriver** - A layer that imports files in the notes into mongo collections in my app and the rest of the app reactvive machinery will do the rest.
The driver will watch github notes repo and grab new changes and make them old auto style. a bit scary.
