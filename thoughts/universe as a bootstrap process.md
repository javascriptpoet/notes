#Universe is solving its own bootstrap problem.
I'm just extrapolating my own experience with bootstrapping my code. Everything we see is an entety created as part of the bootstrap, a gradual build up of parts and tools to create
the ultimate creation. What it is not known as it morphs being built. 
The horizon of expanding universe is the realm of the solution up to the present for each observer.
Each has its own horizon and see dif part of the universe - dif part of the solution. 
This horizon is the scope of a function which is the observer. The script is the universe which is the computer 
running the script as its building the computer. So, why the limit on the speed of light and, therefore, this horizon. 
Because,otherwise, the bootstrap would happen instantly, the universe would finish building the computer and run the script 
instantly, exit the script and there wold not be anyone to say 'fuck, that was too fast' outside the script.

The exit out of the script, in this case, is simply merging of all the differences and distinctions and boundaries and 
individual observers, the whole bloody mess necessary while bootstrapping into the beuaty being built where there is no 
more need for the mess. The ultimate beauty of creation where we have no place. we are the little ants that are building 
it but not for ourselves. We have no place in it and will never see the results. A pity.

Is that the god we are creating? If you call it god, we are bootstrapping him.

fuck, this is another rabbit hole. i'm out of here.
