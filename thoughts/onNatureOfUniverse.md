If you ever wondered what is time (NOT what time) or why time, this might help. Just sharing.
The universe (or anything else in it) is a recursive process. for the sake of economy, the same code is reused by iterations of the same function in a dif context. Each iteration is a tick perceived as tick of time and it is marked by creation of something or a side effect. This is what function creates or affects.
What is space? Simple as well. Those iterations create other functions by rearranging whatever a function can see in its scope. We give those things a name and organize them in containers, NAMESPACES. Its a mental construct. That namespace is local space, then, organized by US into next container. Its same as time but presented dif. Just refactoring we coders call it.
 Our brain simply wired to perceive a recursive process in two dimensions - time and space but its not wired so solid as to completely lock the border between time and space. Therefore this weird back and forth between them. Its a mental construct to be able to deal with recursion just enough to suirvive while deep in its bowels. Its monstrously complex. We doing well.
Cause and effect/direction of time? Thats a no brainer. One iteration follows the other and things/functions are created in sequence using only what been created before. No further thought required. Stop it.
