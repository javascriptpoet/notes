#my life is extended by my online presence<br>
 people of bay area are amazing but my life is extended by my online presence. i have access to the whole world and i really 
 enjoy open source community. They are my mentors, my heroes, my inspiration. I'm really greatful to them for giving 
 me such an awesome tool as web. its the best tool in my freedom toolbox. how cool is it to be able to take all your friends, 
 your whole world with you wherever you go in your tiny minivan. we live in the best times while we live in the worst times,
 we live in the world we create for ourselves and for our friends, we live in the world of humans. Thats what makes it 
 so beuatiful.
 
#On size of human brain, extension of english language and the fools that get betrayed<br>
 what if english had a tagging feature, a simple extension. e.g. 'he{this} who seeks the truth, he who betrays {this} is the fool'
thats really concise and efficient, except our puni brains are just pea size.

#Human communities are the most beuatiful objects in universe<br>
sooner or later, most people go thru an experience that changes us, like a jolt that can kill or bring back to life. I'm very glad i did not disapear into the desert a few years ago cos i love life and i love having my friends in it.Its people in  our lives that makes life worth living.<br>
i think, the skill to share thoughts and ideas with others is essential for buiilding human communities so we can learn from and support each other. Our lives are about our communities (or lack of such), the most beuatiful and intricate objects in universe, beyound even any individual human. And nowdays, we dont even have to be geographically close to belong. We live in truly amazing times. I see myself as helping people using these tools and tech to be free, freedom is fleeting w/o support of a community.This is the human way.
