#my life is extended by my online presence<br>
 people of bay area are amazing but my life is extended by my online presence. i have access to the whole world and i really 
 enjoy open source community. They are my mentors, my heroes, my inspiration. I'm really greatful to them for giving 
 me such an awesome tool as web. its the best tool in my freedom toolbox. how cool is it to be able to take all your friends, 
 your whole world with you wherever you go in your tiny minivan. we live in the best times while we live in the worst times,
 we live in the world we create for ourselves and for our friends, we live in the world of humans. Thats what makes it 
 so beuatiful.
 
#On size of human brain, extension of english language and the fools that get betrayed<br>
 what if english had a tagging feature, a simple extension. e.g. 'he{this} who seeks the truth, he who betrays {this} is the fool'
thats really concise and efficient, except our puni brains are just pea size.
