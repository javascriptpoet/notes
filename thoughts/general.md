#my life is extended by my online presence<br>
 people of bay area are amazing but my life is extended by my online presence. i have access to the whole world and i really 
 enjoy open source community. They are my mentors, my heroes, my inspiration. I'm really greatful to them for giving 
 me such an awesome tool as web. its the best tool in my freedom toolbox. how cool is it to be able to take all your friends, 
 your whole world with you wherever you go in your tiny minivan. we live in the best times while we live in the worst times,
 we live in the world we create for ourselves and for our friends, we live in the world of humans. Thats what makes it 
 so beuatiful.
 
#On size of human brain, extension of english language and the fools that get betrayed<br>
 what if english had a tagging feature, a simple extension. e.g. 'he{this} who seeks the truth, he who betrays {this} is the fool'
thats really concise and efficient, except our puni brains are just pea size.

#Human communities are the most beuatiful objects in universe<br>
sooner or later, most people go thru an experience that changes us, like a jolt that can kill or bring back to life. I'm very glad i did not disapear into the desert a few years ago cos i love life and i love having my friends in it.Its people in  our lives that makes life worth living.<br>
i think, the skill to share thoughts and ideas with others is essential for buiilding human communities so we can learn from and support each other. Our lives are about our communities (or lack of such), the most beuatiful and intricate objects in universe, beyound even any individual human. And nowdays, we dont even have to be geographically close to belong. We live in truly amazing times. I see myself as helping people using these tools and tech to be free, freedom is fleeting w/o support of a community.This is the human way. 

#On slavory vs employement<br>
In short, its the same thing. Its OK, normal and healthy for the larger community to help someone as a trade for a reward in kind or just as an act of kindness. It is not OK when an employer looks at his helper as an emploeer. What these thin abstractions cover in the predominant culture is its ok to be greedy and give as little reward for the help as possible. Then, a distinction is created between those slaves and friends. As any abstraction, it breaks down when let loose into the wide universe - what if an employer wants to be friends with his employee. Short circuit. Hit the red button and make fast rule - 'Managers are not to fraternize with hired help'

#A coder gets good good at building universes<br>
Thats what an abstruction is, creating a way of looking, of organizing thoughts, a world view, a new reality, that takes over oneself and builds a universe inside his head, becomes part of city/community extended by others making up the planet and shaping that, becomin what its shaping, what it is a UNIVERSE.<br>
So, back to the geek. Thats his job, to dream these castles in the sky, get better at it, painfully at first, then by habbit, then by instinct, gaining wisdom and understanding at a faster and faster rate, becoming aware of the whole machine above while the machine does not even know he's there. Driving the machine from within.
That awareness of so many levels up the onion, is what self concience is. Its connectedness of the whole, each peace aware, in contact and dependant on other peaces, more granilar, the higher intellegence of the whole. What is that mechanism of connectivity. Its you, thats what the nature decided is the most efficient way to connect these peaces its got floating around. Whats nature? Its the whole connected universe. Connected by what? YOU and other critters out there. Is universe intellegent and self aware? Its a fact, you are the proof of it.

#Mom Nature did a shitty job, we'll take over from here<br>
our love of violence is our curse. I guess it made us into what we are but we do have the power and understanding to change our culture, to change our nature. we can manage our own evolution from now on, you mom Nature did a shitty job. We'll take over from here.

#Note to myself
The only subjects i'm interested reading is about what interests me at the moment and its better be short, sweet and not too confusing. So, keep it in mind when you decide to write another note, guy.

#On FB addiction
I know a lot of people have trouble with this. Heres my view. <br>
I think the reason, at least by the virtue of my own example, is fb is a window on a mind and thoughts of others a lot more transparent then a tiny peep hole they allow normally. I think it changes everything, like a strong glue that binds disparate and lonely peaces into a solid and worthy object.

#On recursion, reality and why i'm not interested in Cant philosophy
I think those philosophers like Cant that denied physical reality are simply over-complicating the picture. They are fighting recursion and that is a straight shot to madness. Yes, we get the point, reality IS an abstraction but it is there for the good reason that it fits our mental pattern and leave us alone, we dont have as much time as you to ponder the navel lost in your own confusion because you cant figure out how to model recursive processes.
That statement comes after a long bout of my own fighting the same issue. RecursionWiseness is a skill and, i think, one of the hardest to master, Once you do, a lot of confusing issues just snap into focus.
The first step on this road is to realize that recursion, fractals and chaos is how everything in universe is built.

#My view on written word
It should be clear. Nothing new, but, it helps to be dry, using words very sparingly. The more of them, the more the chance of miscommunication by word meaning combinations. Only so many words for so many things by the necessity of our pea size brains.
However, after the message is dried up and shrunk to a dead, unemotional, cold function it is time to spice it up with some silly rhyme, not worth a dime, give it a color, for humans to bother.
OK, back to code.
