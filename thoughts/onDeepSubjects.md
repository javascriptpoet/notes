##Trackees, speed of light is here to stay, get over it.
So, in a logical conclusion and as an aside to all deniers and dreamers of the universe w/o the speed of light traffic cop, 
the existence of the universe is THE proof of its causality, therefore of the necessity of speed of light.
Simply, the universe we are witnessing is a bootstrap process of creation. This process is not instant cos things MUST happen 
in a specific order, like any construction project, because universe can not use what it did not create yet. 
Therefore, causality exist or the process would be instant and we would not exist, cos we only exist as part of that process. 
Therefore, the speed of light - its there to separate things that been created up to now from things that are not yet. 

So, dear trackees, you are confused by a simple bootstrapping problem. I was too, till now.

##Interested to know what time is?
by the way, like a fat cat that falls out of the bag and stays there, here comes the explanation what time is.
It is the sequence of the bootstrap of creation. Like on a construction site, foundation must come 
before walls are built and wall builders must show up AFTER foundation is built, so, they have to keep track of time. 
our brain obliges and creates the perception of time flow in our head. 

Time is our perception of the bootstrap sequence.

##The evil aliens are driving this train
Did you catch me using the concept of now? That is interesting too cos each observer has his own now. 
Its like a flow of a sequential computer script. Each observer is a variable/entity defined at some point in the script and
only has access to what been defined before he was defined. This is your space dimension - your spot in space is 
where you been defined in the script and your horizon/scope is whats been defined before and that is why space and time 
are so similar. The script is being executed one statement at a time in a TIMELY fashion.Time is simply a sequence 
of script execution and space is the definitions/statements in the script. 

The evil aliens run the computer. Tell me where i'm wrong.

##Its worse then that. 
The evil aliens are running the computer but the script the computer runs been written by the evil aliens sweat shop masters.

*The aliens are evil cos if they were better coders, they wouldv defined each one of us at the beginning of the script - the beginning of the universe, big damn bang, and we would'v had the length of the universe as our scope, the extent of our lives. And, wtf with the variables going undefined in the middle of the script. Thats just an unnecessary complication, a bug in the script. They are amateur evil aliens. We need better masters with better debugging tools.

*WE ARE A SELF CONTAINED COMPONENT. <br>
They created us, stuck us in some dungeon of a library and threw away the key. Despair.
