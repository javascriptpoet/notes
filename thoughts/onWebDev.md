#<strong>The purpose of a programmer</strong><br>
Is nobble indeed, to tell the truth clear enough to be understood by those who are seeking it

#I'v learned that deamon of recursion can be controlled 
by cutting its infinite tail at the point where it starts choking your. There is always a point in a recursive process where it originates, nothing is infinite. Beyound that boundary, you can not use the services of your recursive tool. The point where you place that bound is up to you. That is the control you have. The better you get at following recursion into the rabbit hole, the dryer code you can write in a more readable manner reusing bits and peaces composing them. EVERYTHING in universe is composable, not just React

#The task of coder is ...
to learn using recursion properly. Thats what brings code to life. Without it, it has no voice, dead, useless. Its the breath of life. of recursio, all life is created

#there is some connection between language of recursion and poetry. 
I know cos it feels similar in how efficient and powerful of a language each is
i know what it is. I'm using english the same way in poetry and coding, to make things really clear, to tell the truth, however painful it might be to others and myself, it is better to face it right away or be confused for ever.

#We are cursed to live with recursion
Which is a tough roommate, hard, unforgiving, arrogant, mocking, always right, clicky and playing favorites, hanging out only with the smartest ones and humiliating others. 

She is life, she is what life is made out of, she is a bitch and the only way to deal with her is to learn her ways and let her take the lead, join her favorites.

#the source of confusion is the indirections 
which are logical loops thru non-local entities/abstractions. They break encapsulation. That simple. So, the trick is to learn keep all the chickens in the coop while they want to run around, visit the neighbours and spend all day gossiping. What you do is lock the coop and pass just the important messages from the neighbours by mail. What comes to the mailbox? FUNCTIONS, defined by the neighbours in the comfort of their own coop for the unwrapping pleasure of your crew. Keeps them from pecking a hole in your head.

Damn, dude, i'm a chicken warden

#i think the quality of code can be judged by how far off subject the comments stray. 
What they should stray to is clarity and they should stray there on the bus of abstractions, otherwise, chances are code will be as winded and convoluted as the prolific comments.
The coder job description reads: creates abstractions all day long. So, the comments should be forged of that habit.
