Beyound that boundary, you can not use the services of your recursive tool. The point where you place that bound is up to you. That is the control you have. The better you get at following recursion into the rabbit hole, the dryer code you can write in a more readable manner reusing bits and peaces composing them. EVERYTHING in universe is composable, not just React

#The task of coder is ...
to learn using recursion properly. Thats what brings code to life. Without it, it has no voice, dead, useless. Its the breath of life. of recursio, all life is created

#there is some connection between language of recursion and poetry. 
I know cos it feels similar in how efficient and powerful of a language each is
i know what it is. I'm using english the same way in poetry and coding, to make things really clear, to tell the truth, however painful it might be to others and myself, it is better to face it right away or be confused for ever.

#We are cursed to live with recursion
Which is a tough roommate, hard, unforgiving, arrogant, mocking, always right, clicky and playing favorites, hanging out only with the smartest ones and humiliating others. 

She is life, she is what life is made out of, she is a bitch and the only way to deal with her is to learn her ways and let her take the lead, join her favorites.
