* <strong>I just love working here in 24/7 study room on campus</strong><br>
   with the hustle and bustle thru day and night soaking up all the life and laughter in a dozen of languages. I'v gone back to school and i'm a good student.
   The place is filled up at all time. There is not a free table and every new comer finds a place instantly. Just pulls in somewhere with a simple node and a smile. This is the culture of sharing and cooperation, everyone fits in, everyone has a place.
   One more curious fact. There is a huge TV hanging on the wall and I never seen it on. I like that.
   I'm locked into a crowded room and i feel so free.
 

  
* <strong>Hardest i'v ever worked</strong><br>
I spent the night on campus, stubborn to leave to wake up to a gloomy realization I'm confused. The feeling of
intrusion, thats known as confusion. So, i just wondered around campus with sun rising, in the rain, with my board in my bare
hands. Just would not let myself have any fun till i felt like coding again.
It did not work. The issues seem deep and i was loosing track of it, prbly, cos i was dead tired out
of my mind. Finally, jumped on my board and things started improving immidiately, especially after
sliding into that steel post again. The rain turned butter into ice.
<br><br>
It kept getting better all the way to mars rover and a hot cup of coffee and comfy good time on mars. A beam of light
started cracking in. The fog cleared and i saw a vision, of a structure that was whimsical and intricate, in tune with
the flow. It was just right.
Exactly what? The way i thought about it, the same old issue but from a different angle, i climbed out of
my box. The world got bigger. I skated back to the van and started writing prbly best code i ever wrote.
<br><br>...<br><br>
Then, i got back on the board.

*  <strong>i feel my whole world went thru a cataclysm wondering uc berkeley campus on that aweful rainy night.</strong><br>
 it was very hard but everything changed. My mind operates on a higher level of abstraction. I think in terms of composable objects, about anything. 
 its like dissolving into the never never fractal world of recursion, a quantum existence where miracles happen everywhere and everything morphs between infinite number of forms it can take, all the time.
 I mean, i can design recursive chaotic processes in my mind almost by instinct. I am able to imitate what nature does with everything it touches.
 This is the most desired gift I'v ever received and it came from one of open source tribes - my recursion mentors of React.
 I dont know if i made myself clear but my website project just started accelerating exponentially.

* <strong tags='dailyLife nomadLife'>i'm relocating from my adapted home on the bottom of channing street</strong><br>
 as soon as that rain stops, to some hilly locale in north berkeley so i can do laps on that wet butter frozen to ice by the rain while working on my website and watching it taking life of its own. An act of creation mixed with on demand exaltation

*  <strong tags='development composable learning-composable'>its an interesting process</strong><br>
 as i'v opened the gift wrapping and playing with my toy. Say, i'm designing my first profile form. I get an idea to ask for permissions from a manager. Ok, i quickly come up with almost standard implementation and an api to interface with new permission manager that allows to  localize all the permission definitions along with defining a form element for that permission in the permission config form, with default permissions defined alongside locally thru inversion of control using functional programming approaches. Then, i finish my profile form, after a few more of these dreams come true, with permission manager calls in it. All in one breath w/o loosing focus. Then, in leasurly manner, i create an npm package and write PM code the way i designed it. After i get done with profile form, my website is designed and design is battle tested. The rest is not as exciting.

* <strong tags='development composable learning'>api creation patterns, not implementation details feel my head now</strong><br>
so, now, instead of clogging my mind with details of all those multiple api designs that are intricate each in 
its way and dont like playing together, i feel the same available space with api creation patterns which reacty way is one of
. All APIs designed in that pattern will live together happily in another composable structure - a tamed recursion. Forgive me, universe.

* <strong>Working in orinda</strong><br>
By one of my best rides in wilder ranch. Bueatiful day. I will get a lot done and get some good food and see my parents.
This is all i need to be happy. So little. So simple.

* <strong>Disturbing morning</strong><br>
I was woken up last morning/afternoon by something jolting my van. Took a look and theres a car bumping into my side. I get out. Its a young guy crying quietly in public with his head down not even looking at me. The strength of his sorrow drowns me. I want to help knowing it will be futile. hes far gone to even understand. I try to get him out and tell me what happened, anything to keep him from driving, to disrupt his depression. Nothing works. In a few minutes, he slowly drives away. Five other people watched and no one even had an interested look.

* <strong>Nicknames</strong>
Yersterday morning just when i packed bike trailer and about to headed out to UC Berkeley campus, i see a shadow of a guy with a boombox doing a supply run down the railroad tracks. Hey, bro, want a few fresh baggles? I get'm by laundry bags, have a dozen and i throw a bunch over the fence. Hes happy and he tells me 'They call me Miami'.<br>
The street folks are all different but most have this in common - they have a nickname. I never mock, i just ask them for their real name. I want to know them, not how they are perceived by some assholes.

* <strong>the rest of the day</strong><br>
This is too cute. This is a style of programming i'v crafted for myself. It generates code looking like this:
 (go)=>(get)=>(what:whatEver)=>doIt(toIt(go)(get)(whatEver))<br>
On a more serious note, started to run into a few really cool cats hunting the same sacred grounds of uc berkeley.i only seen people skating like that on you tube and each so patient and friendly. <br>
I do but i dont have to tell them any of my disaster stories, they know, they done it, they got banged up, road rashed, escorted out by security, harassed by the cops and they listen patiently and node, yeah, bro. Thats my tribe, i feel one of and welcomed and really humbled.

Thats my day
