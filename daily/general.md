* <strong>I just love working here in 24/7 study room on campus</strong><br>
   with the hustle and bustle thru day and night soaking up all the life and laughter in a dozen of languages. I'v gone back to school and i'm a good student.
   The place is filled up at all time. There is not a free table and every new comer finds a place instantly. Just pulls in somewhere with a simple node and a smile. This is the culture of sharing and cooperation, everyone fits in, everyone has a place.
   One more curious fact. There is a huge TV hanging on the wall and I never seen it on. I like that.
   I'm locked into a crowded room and i feel so free.
 

  
* <strong>Hardest i'v ever worked</strong><br>
I spent the night on campus, stubborn to leave to wake up to a gloomy realization I'm confused. The feeling of
intrusion, thats known as confusion. So, i just wondered around campus with sun rising, in the rain, with my board in my bare
hands. Just would not let myself have any fun till i felt like coding again.
It did not work. The issues seem deep and i was loosing track of it, prbly, cos i was dead tired out
of my mind. Finally, jumped on my board and things started improving immidiately, especially after
sliding into that steel post again. The rain turned butter into ice.
<br><br>
It kept getting better all the way to mars rover and a hot cup of coffee and comfy good time on mars. A beam of light
started cracking in. The fog cleared and i saw a vision, of a structure that was whimsical and intricate, in tune with
the flow. It was just right.
Exactly what? The way i thought about it, the same old issue but from a different angle, i climbed out of
my box. The world got bigger. I skated back to the van and started writing prbly best code i ever wrote.
<br><br>...<br><br>
Then, i got back on the board.
