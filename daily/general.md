* <strong>I just love working here in 24/7 study room on campus</strong><br>
   with the hustle and bustle thru day and night soaking up all the life and laughter in a dozen of languages. I'v gone back to school and i'm a good student.
   The place is filled up at all time. There is not a free table and every new comer finds a place instantly. Just pulls in somewhere with a simple node and a smile. This is the culture of sharing and cooperation, everyone fits in, everyone has a place.
   One more curious fact. There is a huge TV hanging on the wall and I never seen it on. I like that.
   I'm locked into a crowded room and i feel so free.
 

  
* <strong>Hardest i'v ever worked</strong><br>
I spent the night on campus, stubborn to leave to wake up to a gloomy realization I'm confused. The feeling of
intrusion, thats known as confusion. So, i just wondered around campus with sun rising, in the rain, with my board in my bare
hands. Just would not let myself have any fun till i felt like coding again.
It did not work. The issues seem deep and i was loosing track of it, prbly, cos i was dead tired out
of my mind. Finally, jumped on my board and things started improving immidiately, especially after
sliding into that steel post again. The rain turned butter into ice.
<br><br>
It kept getting better all the way to mars rover and a hot cup of coffee and comfy good time on mars. A beam of light
started cracking in. The fog cleared and i saw a vision, of a structure that was whimsical and intricate, in tune with
the flow. It was just right.
Exactly what? The way i thought about it, the same old issue but from a different angle, i climbed out of
my box. The world got bigger. I skated back to the van and started writing prbly best code i ever wrote.
<br><br>...<br><br>
Then, i got back on the board.

*  <strong>i feel my whole world went thru a cataclysm wondering uc berkeley campus on that aweful rainy night.</strong><br>
 it was very hard but everything changed. My mind operates on a higher level of abstraction. I think in terms of composable objects, about anything. 
 its like dissolving into the never never fractal world of recursion, a quantum existence where miracles happen everywhere and everything morphs between infinite number of forms it can take, all the time.
 I mean, i can design recursive chaotic processes in my mind almost by instinct. I am able to imitate what nature does with everything it touches.
 This is the most desired gift I'v ever received and it came from one of open source tribes - my recursion mentors of React.
 I dont know if i made myself clear but my website project just started accelerating exponentially.

* <strong tags='dailyLife nomadLife'>i'm relocating from my adapted home on the bottom of channing street</strong><br>
 as soon as that rain stops, to some hilly locale in north berkeley so i can do laps on that wet butter frozen to ice by the rain while working on my website and watching it taking life of its own. An act of creation mixed with on demand exaltation

*  <strong tags='development composable learning-composable'>its an interesting process</strong><br>
 as i'v opened the gift wrapping and playing with my toy. Say, i'm designing my first profile form. I get an idea to ask for permissions from a manager. Ok, i quickly come up with almost standard implementation and an api to interface with new permission manager that allows to  localize all the permission definitions along with defining a form element for that permission in the permission config form, with default permissions defined alongside locally thru inversion of control using functional programming approaches. Then, i finish my profile form, after a few more of these dreams come true, with permission manager calls in it. All in one breath w/o loosing focus. Then, in leasurly manner, i create an npm package and write PM code the way i designed it. After i get done with profile form, my website is designed and design is battle tested. The rest is not as exciting.

* <strong tags='development composable learning'>api creation patterns, not implementation details feel my head now</strong><br>
so, now, instead of clogging my mind with details of all those multiple api designs that are intricate each in 
its way and dont like playing together, i feel the same available space with api creation patterns which reacty way is one of
. All APIs designed in that pattern will live together happily in another composable structure - a tamed recursion. Forgive me, universe.

* <strong>Working in orinda</strong><br>
By one of my best rides in wilder ranch. Bueatiful day. I will get a lot done and get some good food and see my parents.
This is all i need to be happy. So little. So simple.

* <strong>Disturbing morning</strong><br>
I was woken up last morning/afternoon by something jolting my van. Took a look and theres a car bumping into my side. I get out. Its a young guy crying quietly in public with his head down not even looking at me. The strength of his sorrow drowns me. I want to help knowing it will be futile. hes far gone to even understand. I try to get him out and tell me what happened, anything to keep him from driving, to disrupt his depression. Nothing works. In a few minutes, he slowly drives away. Five other people watched and no one even had an interested look.

* <strong>Nicknames</strong>
Yersterday morning just when i packed bike trailer and about to headed out to UC Berkeley campus, i see a shadow of a guy with a boombox doing a supply run down the railroad tracks. Hey, bro, want a few fresh baggles? I get'm by laundry bags, have a dozen and i throw a bunch over the fence. Hes happy and he tells me 'They call me Miami'.<br>
The street folks are all different but most have this in common - they have a nickname. I never mock, i just ask them for their real name. I want to know them, not how they are perceived by some assholes.

* <strong>the rest of the day</strong><br>
This is too cute. This is a style of programming i'v crafted for myself. It generates code looking like this:
 (go)=>(get)=>(what:whatEver)=>doIt(toIt(go)(get)(whatEver))<br>
On a more serious note, started to run into a few really cool cats hunting the same sacred grounds of uc berkeley.i only seen people skating like that on you tube and each so patient and friendly. <br>
I do but i dont have to tell them any of my disaster stories, they know, they done it, they got banged up, road rashed, escorted out by security, harassed by the cops and they listen patiently and node, yeah, bro. Thats my tribe, i feel one of and welcomed and really humbled.
Thats my day

* <strong>Working comfy in the rain in the van thinking of scopes and things</strong/><br>
Implementing my long time dream of scopes with a few terse lines of code.

* <strong>The streets of bay area gourmet cook guide</strong/><br>
cooking well in the middle of a city or nowhere with just a few sticks and some leftover veggies is really not that hard.
Just dont burn it, use a 6" pipe for a stove, a few sticks or crates around the hood, try to use fresher and better of what you collect and flavor it with herbs, good taste of veggeis themselves or a few packets from a store or condiments.
Don't overcook veggies, stage the layers of that bear. Takes 20-30mins for rice and beans, so smoke a bowl, take a break, ride a board, talk to some mehico folks and have a delicious, healthy, organic, 100% free, from the heart of good people meal for days ahead. You might need to hit that grocery store, maybe once a year. Just another board/bike ride. Its ok.
Oh yeah, dont forget to give half of that to those mehicos. Free shit anyway, have another plate.
The rain might be an issue, firewood supply gets wet. Stash some for kindling and use plain good old unleaded to get the stove started. OMG. Get over it. Just put it in charcoal starter bottle so the cops dont get called and pour some on the napkin, light the bitch and toss.

* Xmass day just quetly passed by<br>
Myself is the only gift giver with the best one in the form of clarity of understanding and the peace it brought, second best is a good skating session on campus after a very successful resupply bike ride to eeast bay. Xmass party at the cal sail club ... did not happen, mustv misunderstood lani with his slured style of lingo. Just worked inside my van. Special mention to the skating sess. Slightly injured ankle by getting thrown off at speed by a manhole whiule staring at some oblivious chick. Yeah, right, not even, at some japanese tourist family. Still, hillarious.<br>
Bart ride is another mention. I'm loaded with bags of fresh produce straight out of whole foods garbage can and the still warm baggels from dumster next to it, standing on the platform waiting for bart train on slow schedule today. A sorry looking sblack street guy crawls up the stairs. I bring my bike to the guy, point at the basket full of fruits and tell him to take whatever he likes. He digs in for a banana, takes a few apples, searches his pockets and hands me his last dollar, all crinkled, with a handful of trinkets that make up his entire life. NO, man, i dont need any money. Please, understand, i just dont have the use for it so you better keep it. I'll find you if i change my mind. The train comes, we get in  and the whole ride he tries to hand me that dollar while i"m throwng baggels at him. Everyone in the car, with santa clause hats on, does not pay any attention, maybe, one faint smile. 
That brings me to another subject, everyone wishes each other peace on earth and asks why we cant be all friends today. It is obvious to me. Cos we humans are limited in scope. Just like my js scripts, each of us see only whats within limited focus of yet more limited brain. The answer to us uniting into the global community and living in peace like any good human community does is the capability of an average brain. The key is to raise smart kids. Independant and free, not slaves to the transparently abusive monetary system that makes my new friend not even know how to repay my kindness besides that dollar that is truly useless to me. I cant eat it and i cant cook with it and i already have enough for the little gas mars rover needs. What i'd love to have back is his friendship or just a happy smile. I never got that.

* The gourmet dinner i cooked with all that produce blew the socks off me. The best meal i ever ate. Not kidding, seafod and a ton of flavors from all the hurbs i dug up in that dumpster. So good and so healthy. I'm getting better at using that pressure cooker and my tin wood stove. This is high tech making us freier. People just a few hundred years ago would think these a miracle.

#Dec 28,16
* <strong>I need so little</strong>
Just a few sticks for dinner, warm sun for my back and my solar panels, friendly neighbours that dont mind marsians and their mars rovers,a little water from a close by stream, a few veggies from the same compassionate neighborly farmers and, most of all, the comfort of mind which is redundant all above provided.

* <strong>Cold van on a new year morning</strong><br>
you know, more and more i just want to sit and write stories. Thats what i do coding, basically. I dream up these abstraction, a way to think about a web of connections and dependancies in a way that fits familiar patterns, like a child to parent relationship. So, i'm coming up with a cover storie and i'm getting better and better at it. So, when you figured out how to use a hammer ... you want to write a few stories with it.

* The efficiency of messaging apps<br>
like fb is completely addictive and a big game changer in communications.The method has flows, like any other method, thats why i and suspect a lot more switched from voice to written form. But, on a lonely new year morning when the sun is slow to warm up my van, libraries are closed, been working out of the van for so long w/o hardly a spoken word, yeah, like this one, thats when i wish we did not switch so quick.
 Efficiency is one thing, but direct human contact is another. No point being efficient in separating us. What if we were just as efficient at uniting and knowing about each other. 
Its the balance. Out of balance is what mad is.

* I'm also coming to realize that most of my troubles with confusion is just a minor technical issue of neglecting my tight schedule of bowl smoking. Like the fire of understanding, neglect it for too long and it starts to die out.

* the day just got better. Look back thru my old code and see this line, like a smile and wink:
return compose().treeWalker(hisMonkeys)(monkeyToys)

* I'm writing this cos i really enjoy reading my notes, except for the part where i go endlessly about some new bright abstraction of the past moment. Please, fellah, dont do it to me and anybody else. Very annoying. Or, if you do, be short, clear and engaging, please.

##every time another one of those ghosts sets up a tent next to my van 
i get involved and feed them and befriend them and i do it for many reasons that are very satisfying but it wrecks a havoc on my life every time and very distracting and dangerous as well. Trying to find a ballance between kindness, friendship, compassion and cruelty and blindness to others. It'll get better as i become stronger and have more to give.

##The freer i get
The more i realize I aquired more bosses then i ever had before. These are all the homeless and desparate, and all the others struggling to be free. I feel responsability to help them,to do well for them as well as myself.

##this attractive well dressed girl shows up and knocks on my window last night in the blistering horizontal rain
and asks me for a favor to charge her phone while she walks her dog. OK. Comes back half an hour later and starts explaining exactly why and how and everything else about why she does not want to stay with that guy. I invite her for a cup of coffee some sunny morning and she likes it. Says she saw me making one on Christmas and it looked so serene. Damn, i wish i could help her. She has to figure it out mostly by herself and its tough, especially for a girl.<br>
Then her boyfriend knocks on the window an hour later. She prbly still wonders the streets looking for answers.

So, to put it in a wider scope, heres a thought. People are just floating about looking for freedom and answers how to become free and they get attracted to anything remotely promissing and the more miserable they are the more curious and braver they get and thats the nobility of the human race, the race of survivors.<brf>
But before you get proud and high and mighty about it, squarels do the same thing. When they get hungry they overcome the fear and eat right out of your hand.

##i found a way to be at home wherever i go. 
homie is the feeling of familiarity. You can ease the focus, put things on automatic and relax. So, the more you cut the confusion the less stress you will have and the more homie your whole life will be. Well, what really helps to cut the confusion is to create little tight homes of containers for everything especially your thoughts where everything is local within your rich and you know exactly where. Guess its called being organized but i just tought myself that cos i could not do coding w/o it.

the huge part is to make everything super easy in each home you create.
##every day, i just sit down and start thinking. 
Thats it, thats my job. Love it.

##B-day
I feel like a true js god on my b-day. I'm ticking my app by my universal grandfarther clock - the ultimate bootstrapping tool. No more confusion by bootstrap issues. The reason it is so confusing cos the time dimension is missing in normal approach, hard to keep track what was created up to any particular point. One can only use whats there. So, if time is there, you just grab the thang you just made up in the previous time slice - a different namespace for each time slice. Thats exactly how reality works. My apps have only a few ticks so no gravity and all that shit but i'm sure it will emerge if i start running that clock and start changing the app structure with each tick, evolving it like universe continuously evolves. Its the difference in local clocks that will create effect of gravity. I have it now - each component has its own clock. Still gets driven from above but slices the ticks any way it wants. Gravity will happen when that arbitrary difference in clocks will be driven by some purpose - apps goal whatever its computing. The gravity will be the tendency towards the right answer. So, bro, here is your answer to THE BIG question - what the fuck is gravity. Its the universe convirging on the answer it is programmed to get. What it is, i dont know but i'll give it a thought, of course.<br>
the universe is a fucking script. theres nothing to disprove it. fits like a glove so i'll call it a duck.<br>
I feel i'm in a dreamland, so, ill go skating and dream while skating, of universes and the purpose of each.

#Jan 27, 17
So, i finally relent and let myself go take a skating break on the most sunny bright of a day after week long rain, on uc campus full of young beautiful faces lost in thought. I smoke a bowl with folks giving me smiles. Its full monty crowded zoo and me discovering new ditsy lines around curbs and yoga pants. Walked up to the tipsy top to the clock tower, all lit up in the setting sun like Alexandria Light House. I guess, that was the intent. They got it, with that san fran bay way down University av. 
Joined a group of high schoolers on a tour and the pretty guide tells us 'The legend says when tower was built, they decided to clear a huge alley down to the sea so when ground cracks it just rolls off and never hurts anyone.' 
I swear, at this point I yell out' 'I'm hopping for the same, jump on my board and accelerate into the sunset towards the bay. NO BULLSHIT. And, run straight into another group of like 100 kids blocking the path completely for 100', no room for speed checks. I just jedeyed it trying not to elbow the kids too much. Break out to the clear and carve fat happy turns to the bottom. Slide to a stop and have a nice conversation with a crazy kid telling me pirate stories from his Baja days.
But, my point is it felt just like skiing tight trees some place in zero creek or the hwy gate run on the Jane. I felt right at home. Welcome back Dmitry. FUCK YEAH!!! All i need is to find some mushrooms for moon (Mars?) shots.

#Jan 30, 17
##so far today
learned how to get universes started.
been warned by a concerned citizen about my troubles if i keep taking his parking spot.
learned why calligraphy and made it part of my coding syntax
wired up another mexican restaurant in the hood as a trade partner
all w/o leaving my van yet, but, a fat lonboarding expedition is coming and so is mexican dinner after, delivered to my van.

##my wardrobe is def improving
found another brand new marmot jacket abandoned for days in the middle of the street. I'm starting to eat like a king munching on falafels, mouth melting fudge muffins and tofu sushi. My hygiene is better as well with access to the campus gym at the top of a funky long boarding line. I like my life. 
With the growing season coming, I'll have access to the whole organic farm next to the world class longboarding resort of el cerrito. For the time being, I'll be helping them with kick ass aquaponic system. Sooo much to do with sooo many friends to have. I'm blown away how many good vibes are all around me.
I think its been three years since I stopped paying a dime for food. I feel healthiest I'v ever been, and happiest and freeest.

##it was a really good day. 
a bike collections mission with ebfnb was a big success. got to meet really cool people, got a ton of food i usually never see. Did not even realize how hungry i was for certain tastes. Got access to the omni building and all its inhabitants. There is always an event going on and a lot of food getting served. A building with no walls and everything is shared between all kinds of groups. Everything in it created and treasured and fought for by all involved. A really active hacker space where i can contribute with the skills i learned. Perhaps start teaching people what i know. I can sense a lot of interes

##wooow. that was a good one.
my whole bike rig including trailer was stolen the night before. Some mongrel cut off the cable while i was sleeping 10' away. You have to understand. the car is not driving at the moment and i will starve quickly w/o an efficient system of supplying myself. Im back 50% into rebuilding the sweetest rig ever. All good. Just lost a day of work. I'v been neglecting keeping up with my fellow travelers like mars rover and the magic gnomer. It will not happen again. I made a few changes. if the mongrel comes back he'll have to deal with one angry martian face to face. Boooo. And, as usual, i did not a spend a dime but the time is way more valuable then that stuff. Bastard took my only functional smoke piece. No problem, i started the magic dust for the magic gnome for breakfast problem. He likes it, so, i'll keep him on that diet.
Wait till i finish the rig in a few days. I'll post pics. its already tight. I feel like invincible ninga w/o trailer flying down staircases and dodging rush hour traffic by inches. Life on the fucking edge, cos i'v been cornered onto that edge and i have no intention of going over that edge and it does not scare me looking over that edge, i see those over it 50 times a day. However, the lesson is - spare some focus on the poor gnome and his lonely rover, they are your most loyal friends.
I'v been on same spot way too long, thats why.
