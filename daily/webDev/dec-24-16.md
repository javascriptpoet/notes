Got js scoping done and started implementing thru the project only to discover this is not the scoping i want,
does not create encapsulation, the syntax not quite right. OK, quickly realized I got a pwoerful tool to customize
scopig of any part of code base. I can create component scoping and js scoping and compose new ones from old ones. So, component 
scoping is what i need instead of js. Any reusable component with a dir structure inside gets component scoping - same as js scoping 
but:
  * encapsulated
  no module inside can see past component top scope/dir
  * scope inheritance is a bit different
  instead of extending outer to inner scope which creates a flat dict of vars and masks namesake vars, 
  the parent scope extended to new inner scope with inner scope vars in their own namespace under child's name
  is added as another namespace creating structure. This is to make destruct statements
  more declarative.<br>
  This creates self contained sandboxes that can be thrown from one project to another w/o any tinkering. Anything that is 
  not visible to modules within their enclosing component will have to be passed to them thru props mechanism from top component 
  scope down. This is done by wrapping module into another func closure and passing params to it and destructing the props in declarative
  manner. These packages are not react but similar to react in spirit each encapsulating a functionality of some kind. In short,
  a react component package will export a react component as default when imported, a sleazyUsedCarDealer component package will yield
  yield a used car dealer, perhaps with his mother in law as a static method.<br>
  The next step will be a package that allows composing these dissimilar package components (need a better name) into an application
  and a gui system that provides a nice way to build it, a drupal of my own.
  
* The name is CodeUnits. <br>
Each CodeUnit is a class, yeah, a es6 class that instantiates the sorce file modules in a proper dir structure represented by 
codeUnit object that describes it. Well, no need to create source code and files, just generate functions as strings and store them
into a mongo collection, maybe, by invoking a CodeUnit#toMongo Then, just go ahead and compose your new website with your good old
trusty code and bypass a huge part of debugging fun.
