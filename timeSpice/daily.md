##morning rain brought this discovery
Separation of time and space is completely arbitrary and that distinction requires work of intellegence organizing and processing
the universe around. Simply, a fairly self contained component of spaceTime, complex enough to be self aware of its purpose - building itself.
In short, us.

##Heres why.
The universe is defining itself just like any component. Thats its program. The way it does it is the way you would think it would do it by
sequentially creating objects and using them in next tick of time to create more objects. Purely timewise approach. BUT, wait ... 
what are those objects its creating? On close observation they appear to be full of other objects being created in sequence and on and on.
There is the finest most refined unbreakable object - node of spaceTime. On the basic timewise level, these nodes are being created in
sequence and thats how universe expands - by building itself.
Then, we get created, rather coalice into an prganized structure and we start organizing those funny nodes around us into abstractions
like into piles of beans - the components of spaceTime, objects. Each is a pile of nodes with invisible borders around it. guess, visible
only to the annoited circle of your friends.
So, by wrapping this border around unsuspecting spaceTime nodes, we translate sequential time into space like structure. BUT, the universe 
keeps ticking its global clock bootstrapping itself to existence. Its not concerned about us anymore. It created us in previous ticks
and uses us as a tool to build oyher things. 
What things. Why? The one we imagine with our minds, of course. We are building the universe with our thoughts.<br>
Tell me where i went wrong?

##This is how it is relevant to js code.
Those objects are js functions. The border is the wrapper func around a sequence of statements and its prop is the local scope. Well, its own scope extended from parent by its home crew. If we manage to create a self contained component that need no help from that crew - we created a universe. In spiceTime lingo, we created a val flavored scope element. If the object is bound to its parent and all parents friends and, then, some others that come into its scope as props, we call it a func flavored element. <br>

##Qm in a nutshell. I'm the nut and timeSpice is the shell.
So, vals are free agents. we have no influence on them and they leave us alone till they ready to deliver their entire being for our purpose, when they are done.
Funcs are our slaves, we rope them in with the strings that control them and we abuse them many times over. Worse, we send them to foreign lands to perform our bidding as the messangers. But, however far away from home they are, they still bound to our local scope and when they executed by some cruel master, they make a difference in our local world. That IS the essence of spooky action at a distance (Einstein was an increadable mind but we all fall into one box or another, beware) quantum entanglement and composed quantum state which is collection of possible values (combinations of them) assigned by func to elements in outer scope. Thats observables as known in qm. We can not see inside func scope, so, all its locals are part of its state but they are hidden in a closer. 
##Now we will take on quantum field theory. 
Remember two flavors of particles - leptons and barrions. Can you guess who is who? Vals are ... barrions. They are heavy from get go, pregnant with all that structure we abstracted into them. They dont interact with any strangers when we send them away. Leptons are func elements. They have no or little or some stationary mass - the ammount of structure they hold. The simple file modules are the litest. They take the lest space and they are fast and do not stay still. We bring them to existence from types - functions that create them. We dont hold them for long but feed them prop fuel, get them all excited. They run around all pregnant, tick for a while (nothing is instant) and spit out result - another particle. Thos props are just that as well - particles, funcs or vals. They eat them all, produce side effects and spit some other particles at the end. Side effects is the force they mediate, props are the energy it takes to produce that force. Result is leftover energy/information
