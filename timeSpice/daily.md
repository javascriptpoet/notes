##morning rain brought this discovery
Separation of time and space is completely arbitrary and that distinction requires work of intellegence organizing and processing
the universe around. Simply, a fairly self contained component of spaceTime, complex enough to be self aware of its purpose - building itself.
In short, us.

##Heres why.
The universe is defining itself just like any component. Thats its program. The way it does it is the way you would think it would do it by
sequentially creating objects and using them in next tick of time to create more objects. Purely timewise approach. BUT, wait ... 
what are those objects its creating? On close observation they appear to be full of other objects being created in sequence and on and on.
There is the finest most refined unbreakable object - node of spaceTime. On the basic timewise level, these nodes are being created in
sequence and thats how universe expands - by building itself.
Then, we get created, rather coalice into an prganized structure and we start organizing those funny nodes around us into abstractions
like into piles of beans - the components of spaceTime, objects. Each is a pile of nodes with invisible borders around it. guess, visible
only to the annoited circle of your friends.
So, by wrapping this border around unsuspecting spaceTime nodes, we translate sequential time into space like structure. BUT, the universe 
keeps ticking its global clock bootstrapping itself to existence. Its not concerned about us anymore. It created us in previous ticks
and uses us as a tool to build oyher things. 
What things. Why? The one we imagine with our minds, of course. We are building the universe with our thoughts.<br>
Tell me where i went wrong?
