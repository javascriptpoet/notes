 #i was asking that myself a lot of times. 
 It does not seem to work for me. The syntax of react is geared towards html generation. yeah, one can use react 
 components to compose anything but that is just silly. its three lines of code to create react like syntax to 
 compose sweet mama from a caw (just ignore it). My tTypes are good example. i'll throw that package on github for you. 
 I got real sweet syntax for form composition and i'm using it, all debugged. My framework makes that composition trivial.
 You just build a type of scope - compose from other types built in and created. Takes a few lines of code to extend those 
 types. And, you abstracted composition into some sexy name of a time tick that performs that sex for you. Next step is to 
 teach it a few nice sex tricks. Forget it.
 Simply, react syntax is good for what react does and my framework is good for other stuff. 
 yes, they both can be used for most anything but so is anything else you see. Its all about how convenient it is. 
 Right tool for the right job. Start unifying different tools and end up with a hammer with chair 
 legs attached and a long manual describing the safety features.
