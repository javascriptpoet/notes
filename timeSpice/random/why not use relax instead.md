#i looked very briefly at relax.
It seems useful but its express based. I just dont see the need for me to mess with express. seems a step back. 
However, perhaps we can use the front end. I dont know how well the code is organized. If it poorly written, forget it, 
i want nothing to do with it. I'd rather  relax on my own

slap me down if i'm being a bitch. I might be just ignorent. i just dont have time to read their code thoroughly. 
I'm very reluctant to use anything js related w/o reading thru the code base. I'll gladly abandon the spiceTime 
framework if we can use something else but it just got a life of its own and learned to defend that life. 
Its out of my hands. It just has way too many features that i'm salivating to start using and its getting better 
and i see visions like flashbacks from the paradise. Remember the granularity and composition of apps and type 
interlocking and automation of app creation. Is there something else that does it all and so efficiently? 
Let me know. I'm not being facitious. I'm seriously asking you. Maybe i'm slamming thru an open door. jsx is 
for generating html. the function being composed by react components tree returns html when executed. Thats it. 
Thats nice but a web app is more then html. so, my stuff is a wrapper around that func and a few others. 
Thats all thats going on here.
