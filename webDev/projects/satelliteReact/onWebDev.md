    ####yeeessss!! shit started to fire. Got my summernote type. 
    it was harder then expected. went thru typical react version hell. jquery and react just hate each others guts, webpack does its own weird packaging stuff that leaves jquery out somehow and they all 
    insist on specific different versions of everything. still, it can all be figured out and forked and well worth the trouble.
