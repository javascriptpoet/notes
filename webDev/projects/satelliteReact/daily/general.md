* <strong>yeeessss!! shit started to fire. Got my summernote type. </strong><br>
    it was harder then expected. went thru typical react version hell. jquery and react just hate each others guts, webpack does its own weird packaging stuff that leaves jquery out somehow and they all 
       insist on specific different versions of everything. still, it can all be figured out and forked and well worth the trouble.

  
* <strong>Summernote is out,react-rte is in</strong><br>
The lesson - do not mess with jquiry and be wary of not pure react implementations. can be very time wasteful
    Still reat-rte does not do ssr. thats for later. Guess if someone lands on that form, theyll get a textbox.

* <strong>its working, the whole setup</strong><br> 
i'm getting faster and more efficient every day. almost mechanical. My brain is spending less of available focus on this
menial tasks that were so confusing ... last night and lets me focus on the next layer of the onion above. This is exponential
scale - each linear step to the surface of the onion doubles or tripples my productivity and quality of the product.

* <strong>Reusing reacty pattern of composability is what makes it work</strong><br>
I dont have to waste concentration on shifting mind gears into some other pattern. It works, just dont want to be bothered
with infinite number of other ways.

* <strong>i think i'm gonna take all these abstractions less serious</strong><br>
they just helpers to acheive the main goal which is to build a nice ui for people that trust you to do it. So, i'll start right there, design eactly the look of it and arrange the whole structure to do it the best i know and i do know a few good tricks of the trade now.

* <strong>the pattern tcomb uses is incredibly useful</strong><br>
He says its based on set theory. I dont know what that means exactly but thru my dreams a workable pattern emerged and guess what ... it is the same as tcomb. i wish i could see it before so much time and effort was expanded but i dont regret anything. The path is never straight.
basically, tcomb is a pattern within similar pattern of the whole app and alongside with other similar patterns. feels so right.

* <strong>functional programming </strong><br>
aaaahhhhaaaa!!!! the answer, my friend, is not blowing in the wind, not anymore. Its known as functional programming which is basically a fancy term for wrapping everything into functions, including parameters to these functions and the functions themselves and passing them around like pregnant whors inverting the control in spite of strict regulations and the strong desire by the authorities to break up my local communities inside each cozy file and spread its guts all over the application. We use functions to tunnel thru the layers of scope we created at the start of the project so we dont have to spend days fixing those scopes when they dont fit the new bright idea. we just plod along with what we got and do it in style with all these whoring functions keeping it all local. It keeps us from following the grand plan of building the app, a very liquid entity. We can just start anywhere and finish that part w/o any other part existing and by the time this part is done, the rest of project has fallen in place, victim to the same old patterns of functional programming and the clarity of sanity in your head. It breaks the symmetry of a nice shiny perfect global structure so promised and never gotten into the chaos of freedom that converges on solution. Granted, the solution will be a bit different for each project, i mean the code base and structure will be different each time but thats a huge blessing and saves me from that little guy from the past telling me how to do it. It will fracture into wonderful variations with each project. The only constant is the whorehouse of pregnant functions carrying messages between my scopes despite strict orders

* <strong>ruthless programminging</strong><br>
the other answer, to the same question of getting anything done, is a ruthlessly selfish style of programming. Dont complicate anything unless it has a direct benefit to the project first, maybe with some eye for future projects but, wtf, i'll be able to change a few lines of my own code if i do it as routine with other guys.
