* <strong>yeeessss!! shit started to fire. Got my summernote type. </strong><br>
    it was harder then expected. went thru typical react version hell. jquery and react just hate each others guts, webpack does its own weird packaging stuff that leaves jquery out somehow and they all 
       insist on specific different versions of everything. still, it can all be figured out and forked and well worth the trouble.

  
* <strong>Summernote is out,react-rte is in</strong><br>
The lesson - do not mess with jquiry and be wary of not pure react implementations. can be very time wasteful
    Still reat-rte does not do ssr. thats for later. Guess if someone lands on that form, theyll get a textbox.

* <strong>its working, the whole setup</strong><br> 
i'm getting faster and more efficient every day. almost mechanical. My brain is spending less of available focus on this
menial tasks that were so confusing ... last night and lets me focus on the next layer of the onion above. This is exponential
scale - each linear step to the surface of the onion doubles or tripples my productivity and quality of the product.
