#All functions called from a module should be defined in scope and properly typed. So, scopeBox#defineVar and scopeBox#defineModule
should be used whenever a function needs to be defined rather then native js declaration. This allows for strict type checking and 
passing props w/o fear of destructuring an undefined object somewhere deep inside nested prop structure on the receiving end
