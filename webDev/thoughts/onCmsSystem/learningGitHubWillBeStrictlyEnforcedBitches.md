## The best CMS available is github with all its awesome tools and ease of use
All thats missing is a farely simple tool to import github files into meteor collections as content
 
 That tool will be ... right, a react component or a component system. just grab a Cms.this or Cms.that and feed them your children
 
 It will not lunch on them but feed them your content instead thru a typical reacty/reduxy api by mapping structured content to your props.
 How the content is structured. Thats up to you and the way you organize your github repo. The Cms tool is just a messenger. 
 Please, be kind to messengers.
 
 So, all future clients, beware, learning github will be strictly enforced, bitches.
