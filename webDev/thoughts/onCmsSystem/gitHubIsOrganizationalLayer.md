## GitHub is an organizational layer
I see CMS split same way html and css are split into organizational html layer and styling css layer. 
* So, organizational layer is already built for us and given a name - github. 
* The clients web site is the styling layer. 
* Whats missing is the browser - the binding layer.

Thats my job before clients slam the door off the hinges.
