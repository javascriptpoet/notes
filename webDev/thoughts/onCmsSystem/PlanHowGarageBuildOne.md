I want to build a better looking me on-line. For the sake of efficiency, these notes will be transformed into meteor collections and chewd up by a web app and spit out as a nice reactive snappy site build with react.

There will be a notesDriver module as described in link above that can be plugged into any web app. 

Thats it. For a good start. The tools to improve notes cration on github can be def built later or adopted from open source.
