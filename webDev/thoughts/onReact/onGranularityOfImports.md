##keep importing practices granular to the smallest possible scale but not any smaller.

I was using index files to import whole dir trees for the want of one component and destructuring the bag full of goodies like spilling all the beens out of a jar and picking your faved one out.

This works till you want to give up the fight on your current nemesis of a component while debugging. WOuld be nice to go level higher in your hierarchy and just delete a line of code in the right place.

Well, you cant do it unless you are granular enough. How granular? That depends on your dir structure, the structure of your thoughts, you whole thought process and reflects on the rest of your life.

###updates:
* On the second thought, the reasoning is faulty.
Providing indexes for loading whole dir is useful to dry pricipal and provides a buffer layer. Need to drop a file, just
comment out the line in index file or redirect to other file. 
Indexing is in again
