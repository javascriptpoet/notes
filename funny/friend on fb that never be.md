#I got a friend request 
from an amazing looking neighbour in Orinda of female flavor. 
I did not waiver from being braver and immidiately fired up a response to invite her to my next skating sesh
in the rain. This is how it went:

do i know who you are? 
Perhaps i know your reasons instead. Reasons come from reason and your reason is to seek all unreasonable, needy, lonely. 
Why are you seeking them?. Again, let me guess. ... Money. 
I know youd be rather doing something else then exposing to butt ugly sixty year old longboarders ... but, still, 
if you want to come and shoot me skating next time it rains, i might just miss a lap waiting for you. 
How I look? Pretty ugly but i wear a full face helmet. 
Its OK.
