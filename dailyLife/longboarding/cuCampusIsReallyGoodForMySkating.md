##CU Berkeley campus is really good for my longboarding. 
i started to have these roudy sessions a few times a day ripping and sliding these farely gnarly hills full of students 
and slow moving professors thru the narrow paths. its pretty gnarly and mistakes can be painful so i aim for soft looking chicks.
